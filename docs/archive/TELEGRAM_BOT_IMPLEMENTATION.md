## ✅ Testing Checklist:

After starting the bot, test these commands in Telegram:

- [ ] `/start` - Check welcome message shows mockETH info
- [ ] `/help` - Verify all commands are listed
- [ ] `/balance` - Should show both ETH and mockETH
- [ ] `/mocketh` - Claim 10 free mockETH (test transaction)
- [ ] `/balance` - Verify mockETH balance increased
- [ ] `/stake 0.001` - Stake small amount of ETH
- [ ] `/mystake` - View stake info and pending rewards
- [ ] Wait 60 seconds
- [ ] `/mystake` - Check rewards increased
- [ ] `/claim` - Claim mockETH rewards
- [ ] `/balance` - Verify mockETH balance increased
- [ ] `/unstake` - Unstake ETH + claim remaining rewards
- [ ] `/balance` - Verify ETH returned and mockETH increased

### Natural Language Tests:
- [ ] "check my balance"
- [ ] "stake 0.01 ETH"

## 📝 Implementation Notes:

### Staking Flow:
1. User stakes **native ETH** (e.g., `/stake 0.01`)
2. ETH is locked in StakingPool contract
3. Rewards accumulate as **mockETH** tokens (1% per day)
4. User can `/claim` mockETH rewards anytime
5. User can `/unstake` to get ETH back + remaining mockETH rewards

### MockETH Token:
- ERC20 standard token
- Used exclusively for staking rewards
- Available via free faucet for testing
- Can be viewed on BaseScan like any ERC20 token

### Error Handling:
- All commands have try-catch blocks
- Clear error messages shown to users
- Errors logged to console for debugging
- Transaction failures show descriptive messages

---

## 🔍 Debugging:

If bot doesn't work:

1. **Check Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   node -e "require('dotenv').config(); console.log(process.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN ? 'Bot token OK' : 'Bot token missing')"
   ```

2. **Check Wallet Has ETH:**
   ```bash
   node check_current_stake.js
   ```

3. **Test Contract Access:**
   ```bash
   node -e "require('dotenv').config(); const {createPublicClient, http} = require('viem'); const {baseSepolia} = require('viem/chains'); const client = createPublicClient({chain: baseSepolia, transport: http(process.env.BASE_RPC_URL)}); client.getBlockNumber().then(console.log)"
   ```

4. **Check Bot Logs:**
   - Look for "✅ Basely bot is running!"
   - Check for any error messages
   - Verify network and contract addresses displayed correctly
